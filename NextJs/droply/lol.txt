drizzle is just an orm layer 
that writes sql on our behalf
  
Final Summary (Corrected View)
generate: Figures out what’s changed → writes SQL for it (like git diff + git add)
migrate: Applies those changes to DB (like git commit)
push: Skips writing SQL → just directly changes the DB (like a force push or hotfix)
