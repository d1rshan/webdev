JavaScript vs TypeScript

- JavaScript is dynamically typed (like Python), we know type of variables at runtime
- TypeScript is statically typed (like C,C++, Java), we know type of variables at compile time

Problem with dynamically typed languages
let number = 10
number = "a"
Math.round(number) // expects a number but now it is a string so we won't know this error at compile time

Benefits of TypeScript
- not just limited to type checking
- code completion, refactoring

Drawbacks of TypeScript
- transpilation - as browsers dont understand typescript first they have to translate it to javascript for it to work
- not fun fr
- for simple projects js maybe better


- use: tsc "typescript file name" for translating typescript to javascript
