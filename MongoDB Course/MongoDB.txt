MONGOOSE
what is mongoose?
- mongoose is a ODM (Object Data Modelling) library for MongoDB and Node.js
- mongoose makes it easier to work with MongoDB in Node.js by providing a 
higher level abstraction layer
- basically allows us to use classes and objects (schemas) and allows us to use them to directly
do MongoDB operations
